-What is ML?

	- Give machines the ability to "learn" (progressively improve at a given task)
	- Not explicitly programmed to do a task.

- Why use ML?
	
	- The real world is complex.
	- Best solution may not be obvious.

- What makes it Unique?

	- Completely different mode of thinking.
	- Mimics "real life".

- What is a GA?

	- Algorithm based on "survival of the fittest"
	- Create a set of solutions, and collectively "breed" towards the solution you want.

	- Steps:

	- Initialization

	- Selection
	- Crossing (breeding)
	- Mutation

- Extra tidbits

	- Example is very simple. Real world not that nice.
	- Avoid Local Maximums
	- Look for "good enough", not "perfect"
